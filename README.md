Library Management System Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a robust application developed using Hibernate within a Maven project structure. This system efficiently manages library operations through a relational database consisting of four key tables: Librarian, Member, Books, and Transactions.

✨Librarian: This table stores information about the librarians managing the library, including their credentials and roles.
✨Member: This table keeps track of library members, capturing their personal information and membership details.
✨Books: This table contains all the books available in the library, including metadata like title, author, Price, and quantity  and id that automatically generated.
✨Transactions: This table records all interactions between members and the library, such as book checkouts, returns and viw and search.
A notable feature of this LMS is the email integration for newly registered librarians. Upon registration, an automated email is sent to the librarian, confirming their account creation and providing important registration details. This feature enhances communication and ensures a smooth onboarding process for new staff.

Overall, the Library Management System streamlines library operations, making it easier for librarians to manage resources and for members to access books efficiently.
